# Questions

I've been working with git and GitHub for some years now and been teaching git flow to students for 5 years, so I can't really say I have questions regarding pull requests.

However, the next exercise about merge conflicts I am certain ill teach me a few gotchas that I haven't known about before.

And then again. When I set up repositories for collaboration exercises on GitHub, in settings I can choose that a pull request requires a review from `Code Owner`. I am not completely sure who this is. I have a gut feeling that code owner refers to the person who made the pull-request, i.e. the person who pushed the code that is requestd for a pull. In what circumstances would the creator of the code in question be required to review his or her own code? I don't really see the use-case.
